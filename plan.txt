About Page (Will be the opening page)

	Joshua Remlinger is a software/web designer and programmer. As well as a music producer. At the age of 14 his love for programming began as he got 
	heavily interested in modding PC video games. Due to the sparse resources he could find online he had to learn everything from scratch with no guide into 
	the specifics of what he had to do, which built up a solid framework for his future programming ventures. During high school his love for programming grew 
	even more, eventually becoming one of his favorite past-times. In high school Joshua also discovered the world of music production, and was drawn to it because 
	of how similar it feels to programming, but with a much more artistic result. By the end of high school Joshua was en route to college for computer programming, 
	as well as signed to a music label which releases and promotes the music that he still makes in his free-time.
