About Page (Will be the opening page)

	Hello! I am a software/web designer as well as a music producer. At the age of 14 my love for programming began as I got 
	heavily interested in modding PC video games. Due to the sparse information on modding I found online I had to learn programming from the ground up and 
	teach myself how to use tha knowlege for modding, which built up a solid framework for my future programming ventures. During high school my love for programming grew 
	even more, eventually becoming one of my favorite past-times. In high school I also discovered the world of music production, and I was drawn to it from how 
	similar it feels to programming in its approach, but with a much more artistic result. By the end of high school I was en route to college for computer programming, 
	as well as signed to a music label which releases and promotes the music that I still make in my free-time.

Web Projects

Checkers - Just a simple checkers game!

Cube Game - Very simple 2d game where you control a cube who needs to get to a goal while avoiding stationary enemies. Every stage is randomly generated and I also 
implemented an AI into the game to play it for you.

Pixel Grid - My first major web project. It is a 16x16 grid where you can draw or make procedural patters.

Music

Alias: ToxicOmega
Label: Currently signed to Dikena Records

Style: Wide range of electronic styles, usually accompanied by acoustic or foley elements. I generally try to always go for something that hasn't been done before. Whether 
that be from the sounds themselves or how I made them.

(SOCIAL LINKS To SPOTIFY, ITUNES, YOUTUBE)

Other

(Here I only have one thing for now but perhaps as I continue as a programmer I'll get more to add here)

ToxicUtility - This is my in-progress C# library I've made from scratch. C# is probably my favorite language of all time, but it lacked some of the tools I often use 
to modify games. I'm still adding more features but currently it has the functionality to read and write to a live programs memory in real time. I hope in the future to build 
it further into a multi-purpose application manipulation library.
